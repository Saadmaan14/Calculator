# Calculator

This is a simple calculator web application that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also provides options to clear the screen, delete the last input, add decimal points, and calculate results. The calculator is styled with a modern dark interface and responsive button design.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for the structure of the calculator, CSS styles the layout and appearance, and JavaScript powers the logic that updates the display and evaluates expressions. User inputs are handled through on-screen buttons, and the calculator updates in real time.

To run the project, download the files `calc_index.html` and `calc_style.css` into the same folder and open `calc_index.html` in any modern browser. The calculator will load instantly and can be used by clicking the buttons on screen.

Key features include support for numbers, decimal points, and the four basic operators. The AC button clears all input, the DE button deletes the last character, and the equals button evaluates and displays the result of the entered expression.
